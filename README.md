# park-quick-info

This uses the National Parks API to get quick information for any National Park in the US.


**The user will need to get their own API key from here: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm

To run the app locally, create a new variable called npsAPI with your API key as the value in a string.
  Ex: const npsAPI = "your-key-here";
